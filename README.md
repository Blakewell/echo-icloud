# echo-icloud

This is a project in its beginning stages to connect the iCloud to Amazon Echo (Alexa)

#Usage

All commands begin with "Alexa, ask *iCloud*...".  *iCloud* is the name that I chose when creating my Alexa skill, but you can name it something to your liking.    

### Find your phone

*Find my iPhone
*Find my phone
*Where is my iPhone?
*Where is my phone?
